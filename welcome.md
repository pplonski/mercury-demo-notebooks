# Mercury demo notebooks ðŸš€

This is a website with demo notebooks. It was created from Python notebooks with <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mercury" target="_blank">Mercury</a> framework. 

The Mercury converts notebook into a web application. It can add interactive widgets to the notebook. The end-user can tweak widgets values and execute notebook with new parameters. The resulting notebook can be downloaded as PDF or HTML file. What is more, you can easily add authentication to your notebooks ðŸ”‘. I've created a demo user for you, if you would like to see private notebooks in this website. Please [login](/login) with username (`demo`) and password (`super-secret`).

The source code for notebooks is available on the GitHub on <a href="https://github.com/pplonski/mercury-demo-notebooks" target="_blank">pplonski/mercury-demo-notebooks</a>.

The Mercury is open-source. We provide commercial license for users that are looking for more features, white labeling, and dedicated support. You can find more information about Mercury on our [website](https://mljar.com/mercury). If you have any questions please contact us by email `contact@mljar.com`.
